This is a WordPress plugin for adding Biblefox to a WP blog.

It follows the WordPress SVN conventions of using trunk, because it eventually gets pushed to the WP.org SVN repository.
For testing the plugin, you must copy the trunk directory to your WP plugins folder, and rename it biblefox-for-wordpress.

It also uses submodules, so upon cloning you should call:

	git submodule update --init
